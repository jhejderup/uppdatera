The T. J. Watson Libraries for Analysis (WALA) provide static analysis capabilities for Java bytecode and related languages and for JavaScript.
The system is licensed under the Eclipse Public License, which has been approved by the OSI (Open Source Initiative) as a fully certified open source license.
The initial WALA infrastructure was independently developed as part of the DOMO research project at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center.
In 2006, IBM donated the software to the community.
